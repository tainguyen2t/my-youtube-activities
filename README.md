# My YouTube Activities

This project dives into my **YouTube watching history** — from hours of `Billiard Carom` matches I swore I’d learn from 🎱, to Vietnamese game shows - `2 Ngày 1 Đêm` -  where everyone’s laughing but I’m just procrastinating.  
From rap playlists (`B Ray`, `Post Malone`, `MCK`, `Bạn có tài mà` on repeat) to late-night `Mixigaming` streams, this is basically my **visual diary of how I kill time** 📺.

## Project information
- **Conducted by**: Tai Nguyen *(tainguyen0604@gmail.com)*
- **Period**: Aug 24th - Aug 26th 2025 *(Data exported from Google Takeout – timestamps normalized to UTC+7)*
- **Contribution breakdown:**
    | Source             | Description                                                                 | %     |
    |--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|
    | **Self-conducted** | Data transform, cleaning, JSON extraction, thumbnail archaeology           | 60%   |
    | **AI-assisted**    | Wordcloud wizardry, treemap sorcery, graph styling therapy                 | 30%   |
    | **Random Googling**| *“How to make matplotlib not look like it was made in 1995”*               | 10%   |
    > ***Behind the scenes**: Turns out I wasn’t watching videos — the algorithm was watching me unravel in 4K.*

## Project objectives
1. **Analyze my complete watch history**: billiard binges, game show marathons, streamer chaos and the occasional “life advice” video I never followed  
2. Discover **viewing patterns** — 2 AM sessions are 90% podcasts and motivational talks I put on just to fall asleep 🌙  
3. Identify my **most-watched channels and videos** — from `Đông Tây Promotion`’s gameshow universe to `Mixigaming`’s late-night chaos  
4. Spot the **genre phases**: 2019–2020 was peak “YouTube-as-Spotify” era, when I streamed music non-stop but somehow my top channels were still `Carom billiard tutorials` 🎱  
5. Visualize my **YouTube addiction curve** with charts that make it look like research instead of escapism  


## Contents
- `notebooks/my-youtube-activity-2025-08-24.ipynb`: main notebook with full analysis
- `outputs/images/`: wordclouds, treemaps, channel/video stats
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies for scraping/processing/plotting
- `README.md`: this file (the part where I overshare)

## Tools used
- **Python**: `ipython`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `json`, `os`, `requests`, `datetime`, `dateutil`, `urllib`, `wordcloud`, `squarify`, `PIL`
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- Data exported from **Google Takeout (YouTube History)**

## Notes
- All personal data has been **anonymized** where appropriate.
- Timestamps normalized to **UTC+7** for consistency.
- This is not a *content recommendation system* — it’s just **me vs. my watch history**.
- Dataset includes videos, channels, and thumbnails (yes, even the cursed clickbait ones).
